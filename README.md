# Dragon Ball Z3: A Wish-granting Theorem Prover for Everyone

## Input
Dragon Ball Z3 (DBZ3) takes an input as a list of pairs `(sid, wish, happiness)` where
`sid`, `wish` and `hapiness` are integer values each of which denotes a student id, a wish,
and a hapiness score. 

## Output
The output of DBZ3 is an assignment from `sid`s to `wish`s that maximizes the total
hapiness score of all students.
